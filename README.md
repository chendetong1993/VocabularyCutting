## Project description ##

This project is used for memoring vocabulary quickly. I used it to overcome the vocabulary of GRE in one month. Most code is wrote by C# with WPF at 2015 (when I was a student), some of functions might not work currently due to some web api changes.

This project contains the following features:
1. Support viewing words in windows metro style. (Really good at visulization)(you can right click the word to flip word card, change the lightness of card and so on)
2. Support a great amount of word filters. (Such as hidden/shown the word I memorized, hidden/show the word in same groups)
3. Support import/export user's own vocabulary list.
4. Suport automatically download meanings, pictures, pronunciations and examples from the internet. (Use Web API)
5. Support memorize Vocabulary (A window)
6. Support test Vocabulary (A window)
7. Support remindering user to memorize vocabulary depends on forgetting curve 
8. Support establish groups with words (Use "Ctrl" to select multipuly words, "Ctrl" + "A" to select all the words)
