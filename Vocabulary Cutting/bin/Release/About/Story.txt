  A past story: "Hi, I am a ELS student from China. I am pleased with that you can use my software. One weeks ago, I suddenly found that I almost forgot half of vocabulary which I memorized laboriously one month ago. That time, I felt depressed. I even wanted to give up; Fortunately, at that time, I rapidly kept calm and attemped to find the reason why it happened. Two of the primary reason which I found were that I did not review vocabulary immediately and i did not memorize vocabulary in an organized way, such as using synonym, antonym, roots, suffixs and derivative. Then, I tried to find some software which could help me, but i failed. At that moment, I decided to program a new software to help me. After a week's programming, the first beta version was released at March.15th.

  A short annocement: I am sorry about that -- Because, I have not lots of list to publish, so you need to estalish lists(Just finding vocabulary) by yourself. Although establishing lists is hard, when you finish establishing, you will realize the efficiency of memorizing vocabulary. I hope this software can help you to overcome a large amount of vocabulary in the shortest time. 

  GRE TOTEL IELES SAT are peice of cake.

  Remember: No Paid, No Gain!
